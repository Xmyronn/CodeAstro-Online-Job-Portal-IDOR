Broken Access Control in CodeAstro Online Job Portal Allows Arbitrary Job Deletion

## Details
- **Vendor:** CodeAstro
- **Product:** Online Job Portal Project in PHP MySQL
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Vulnerability Type:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **CWE:** CWE-639
- **Affected File:** /jobs/job-delete.php
- **Parameter:** id (GET)
- **Impact:** An authenticated employer can delete any other employer's 
job posting by manipulating the id parameter in the request.

## Description
The Online Job Portal Project in PHP MySQL developed by CodeAstro 
fails to verify whether the authenticated user owns the job posting 
before processing a delete request. By changing the `id` parameter 
in the GET request, an attacker can delete job postings belonging 
to other employers.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Register two employer accounts (Employer A and Employer B)
2. Log in as Employer A and create a job posting — note the job ID
3. Log in as Employer B in a different browser
4. Intercept the delete request for Employer B's own job using Burp Suite
5. Change the `id` parameter to Employer A's job ID
6. Forward the request
7. Employer A's job posting is deleted successfully

## PoC Request
step 1:- 
GET /online-job-portal-php-mysql/jobs/job-delete.php?id=[victim_job_id] HTTP/1.1
Host: target
Cookie: [attacker_session_cookie]

from user A we will make a new job post and we will take note of the id here which is 41

step 2 :- 
from the user B we will delete its job post but intercept it using burp

as we can see the user B job post id is 39

step 3 :-
we can change the job post id from 39 to 41 and delete user A job post with user B account

in this picture we can see that the job post id has been changed from 39 to 41 

and then we can see that it has been successfully deleted

step 4 :- 
if we go to the user A account and look for the postedJobs endpoint we can see that the job post has been deleted

## Response
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: /online-job-portal-php-mysql/users/postedjobs.php?msg=deleted

## Impact
Any authenticated employer can permanently delete job postings 
belonging to other employers on the platform, causing data loss 
and disruption of service.
